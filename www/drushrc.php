// in the Drupal installation directory DRUPAL_ROOT. Alternatively you can place

 * Command-specific options for dgb.
 *
 * To define options that are only applicable to certain commands,
 * make an entry in the 'command-specific' structures as shown below.
 * The name of the command may be either the command's full name
 * or any of the command's aliases.
 *
 * Options defined here will be overridden by options of the same
 * name on the command line.  Unary flags such as "--verbose" are overridden
 * via special "--no-xxx" options (e.g. "--no-verbose").
 *
 * Limitation: If 'verbose' is set in a command-specific option,
 * it must be cleared by '--no-verbose', not '--no-v', and visa-versa.
