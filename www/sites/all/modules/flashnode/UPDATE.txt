Updating from flash node version 5 to version 6
-----------------------------------------------

It is essential that all users of flash node read these instructions!
Failure to do so may break your flash nodes!


Upgrading from 5.x.3.1 or earlier
---------------------------------
If you are currently using flash node 5.x.3.1 or earlier then you MUST update
your existing site to flash node 5.x.5.3 or later before moving to Drupal 6.
Drupal 6 makes a change to the {files} table that breaks the way earlier flash
node versions access it. Updating to the latest version of flash node 5.x will
patch flash node in preparation for this change. Users of flash node 5.x.4.0
and later do *not* need to upgrade their existing installations first.

To update earlier versions of flash node in preparation for upgrade to Drupal 6
please do the following:

1. Backup your database (or as a minimum, the {flashnode} table)
2. Download the latest flash node release from drupal.org/project/flashnode
3. Log in to your site as the administrator
4. Upload the flashnode files to your flash node module directory
5. Run update.php
6. Update 9 is applied to your flash node installation and fixes the issue

You can now proceed to upgrade your site (after checking other modules to see
if they have any specific upgrade requirements!) Follow the instructions below.


Upgrading from 5.x.4.0 and later
--------------------------------
Simply upgrade flash node along with the rest of your site using the normal
Drupal upgrade method (i.e. disable custom modules, upgrade the site, reinstall
custom modules, run update.php)

There are useful resources such as videos at drupal.org/drupal-6.0

Once you have installed flash node 6.x it is essential to run update.php as
flash node update 6000 must be applied. This update is required to make
existing flash nodes work. If flash node update 6000 is not applied existing
content will not display.
