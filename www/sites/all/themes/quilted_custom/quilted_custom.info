; "core" specifies the version of Drupal that this theme is compatible with.
; "base theme" specifies that this is a theme that uses the "zen" theme as its
; base theme. Its unlikely you will ever need to change these, but they are
; required fields for a Zen sub-theme. The "engine" field is not used in a
; sub-theme since the engine is inherited from its base theme.

  core       = 6.x
  base theme = zen


; This section adds CSS files to your theme. The media type is specified in
; the brackets. Typical CSS media types include "all", "screen", "print", and
; "handheld". See http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html#media-types for a full
; list of stylesheet media types in CSS 2.1. The iPhone's preferred media type
; is based on the CSS3 Media queries. http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/
;
; You can also override any of Zen's stylesheets or any module's stylesheets,
; an /extremely/ useful feature. See the excellent Drupal 6 Theme Guide at
; http://drupal.org/node/171209 for more details.

; We are using the following stylesheets from the Zen theme by *not* overriding them:
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/html-elements.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/wireframes.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/backgrounds.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/tabs.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/messages.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/pages.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/block-editing.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/blocks.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/navigation.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/views-styles.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/nodes.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/comments.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/forms.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/fields.css
  ; stylesheets[print][]    = css/print.css
  ; stylesheets[handheld][] = css/mobile.css
  ; stylesheets[only screen and (max-device-width: 480px)][] = css/iphone.css

; We are overriding the following stylesheets from the Zen theme by loading files 
; that don't exist in our subtheme directory
  ; There are currently no files we are "zero-ing out". If we want to do this, we 
  ; uncomment the following line. This would eliminate the default Zen declarations 
  ; in that file.
  ; stylesheets[all][]      = css/nodes.css

; We are loading the following stylesheets taken directly from the Zen theme:
  ; stylesheets[all][]   = css/zen/layout-fixed.css
  ; stylesheets[all][]   = css/zen/layout-liquid.css ; Use this one or the one above.

; We are loading our custom stylesheets here last to provide our own customizations:
  stylesheets[all][]   = css/quilted_custom.css
  stylesheets[print][] = css/print.css

; Set the conditional stylesheets that are processed by IE.
  ; conditional-stylesheets[if IE][all][]       = css/ie.css
  ; conditional-stylesheets[if lte IE 7][all][] = css/ie7.css
  ; conditional-stylesheets[if lte IE 6][all][] = css/ie6.css

; Optionally add some jquery scripts to your theme.
  ; scripts[] = js/quilted_custom-jquery.js
  ; scripts[] = js/cufon-yui.js
  ; scripts[] = js/font_name.font.js
  ; scripts[] = js/quilted_custom-cufon.js


; The regions defined in Zen's default page.tpl.php file.  The name in
; brackets is the name of the variable in the page.tpl.php file, (e.g.
; "[content_top]" in the .info file means there should be a $content_top
; variable in the page.tpl.php file.) The text after the equals sign is a
; descriptive text used on the admin/build/blocks page.
;
; To add a new region, copy Zen's page.tpl.php to your sub-theme's directory,
; add a line line to this file, and then add the new variable to your
; page.tpl.php template.

  regions[left]           = left sidebar
  regions[right]          = right sidebar
  regions[navbar]         = navigation bar
  regions[content_top]    = content top
  regions[content_bottom] = content bottom
  regions[header]         = header
  regions[footer]         = footer
  regions[closure_region] = closure


; Various page elements output by the theme can be toggled on and off. The
; "features" control which of these check boxes display on the
; admin/build/themes config page. This is useful for suppressing check boxes
; for elements not used by your sub-theme. To suppress a check box, omit the
; entry for it below. See the Drupal 6 Theme Guide for more info:
